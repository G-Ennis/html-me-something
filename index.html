                <article>
                <p>It all started with an idea when I was in middle school...</p>    
                <p>I could go to England to attend a language school to learn English. The thought was so exciting! Unfortunately the excitement didn't last long when we realized how expensive it could be to study abroad. My family wasn't able to afford it.</p>
                <p>Fast forward to a few years later, I heard about this program that made it possible for young people to visit a foreign country as an au-pair. An au-pair would live with a host family for room and board, in return she would provide part-time child care for them and even get paid! I was totally on board with idea. I liked children!</p>
                <p>In 1999, through an organization, I applied to be an au-pair. Shortly after I heard from a family in London! They liked my profile and invited me to be their au-pair. Within a few months I was living in Stratford, in East London. I couldn't be any happier to find a great family with two little girls, Sonny and Moni. Soon after I was taking ESL classes at a local school where I made many friends from different countries.</p>

                <p>I stayed in England for two years. I have great memories visiting the famous landmarks of London and hanging out with my friends. I also worked part-time at my host family's publishing business, managing subscriptions and doing Couples Connections which was a fun job!</p>
                <p>After returning from England, I was trying to decide what to do. During that time I started to think about visiting another country while I had the chance. I could go to another European country but I thought it would be so cool to visit the United States. I could improve my English and visit the U.S. for a year.</p>
                <p>I was again so lucky to be placed with a wonderful family in Grand Rapids, Michigan. By far my experience had surpassed the one I had in England. Everything was so organized. When I first arrived, I had a 3-day orientation in New York with about another hundred au-pairs from around the world. I remember they kept reminding us to tip drivers, waiters etc. : ) Overall the orientation was great.<br>
                In Michigan, I had an au-pair coordinator with a group of about ten au-pairs, which we all became really good friends. We had monthly activities and did a lot of fun stuff. As a part of my au-pair program, I had to take college courses where I learned some Spanish. I had several fun vacations with my host family. All are great memories. It is now hard to believe that the kids I took care of, Colin and the twins Blake and Miranda, are already college age. I still see their little faces when I think of them.</p>

                        <p> Surprisingly most people don't know what an au-pair is and what is required to become one. And often times people think an au-pair is like a "nanny" but there are differences. Here is an article that explains the differences well. <a id="reference" href="https://www.aupair.com/en/p-nanny.php">Au-Pair vs Nanny?</a></p>

                    <p>I finished my year as an au-pair here. About six months into my stay I met Josh. We got married and I ended up staying here. Shortly after we got married, we moved to St. Louis, MO and lived there for about fifteen years. And now we are living in the Tampa Bay area for about six months. It's interesting how one event led to another. I'm happy with how everything has turned out. I love the U.S. and it's people! </p>
